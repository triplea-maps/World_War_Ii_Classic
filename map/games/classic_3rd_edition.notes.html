The Classic 3rd Edition of a World War II game.
			<br> Axis need to at the end of the round control 2 out of 3 allied capitols plus their own capitols to win OR get to 84 production at end of round.
			<br> Allies need to control both Axis capitols plus their own capitols.
			<br> (Optional rule: Allies win if they get to 110 production at end of round [to enable, change Allied economic victory from 140 to 110]).
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>New Features in Third Edition Rules (over 2nd Edition):
			<br>Defending submarines can submerge or retreat from combat. A submerged sub stays in the same sea zone until after combat when it re-surfaces.
			<br>Fighters and Bombers can now retreat from an amphibious assult.
			<br>Multiple AA guns in one territory are allowed.  However, only one AA gun per territory can fire per turn.
			<br>You can now place naval units in a seazone occupied by enemy units. If you do, combat will occur during the opponent's next combat phase, unless they move out of the zone first.
			<br>Western Canada no longer borders the Atlantic Ocean.  This keeps players from being able to move units from the Atlantic ocean directly into Western Canada.
			<br>
